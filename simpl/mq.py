    Peak detection, based on the McAulay and Quatieri (MQ) algorithm.

    A peak is defined as the point in the spectrum where the slope changes from
    position to negative. Hamming window is used, window size must be
    (at least) 2.5 times the average pitch. During voiced sections of speech,
    the window size is updated every 0.25 secs, to the average pitch.
    During unvoiced sections, the window size is fixed at the value of the
    last voiced frame. Once the width is specified, the Hamming window is
    computed and normalised and the STFT is calculated.
